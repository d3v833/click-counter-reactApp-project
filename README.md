# Learning Test Driven Development with Jest and Enzyme!

Jest is a powerful, flexible testing framework, and Enzyme provides tools to test React and Redux applications.

### This course project I'll learn to test:

- Connected and unconnected components
- Component state and Redux state
- Action creators and reducers
- Complex action creators that use Redux Thunk and Axios
- Action creators called from connected components

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
