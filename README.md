# Learning Test Driven Development with Jest and Enzyme!

Click Counter App Project - Designed by Bonnie Schulkin, Software Engineer at Lyft

### In this course project I learned the process of testing using Jest and Enzyme:

- Learned how to do Red-Green Testing || Test Driven Development
- used enzymes shallow() to render component
- used find() to test if the DOM elements were rendered
- used setState() & state() to test Initial States
- used simulate to interact with renderd elements (clicked button)
- tested components for updates after interaction
- creatd re-usable setup() and findByTestAttr() functions
- learned when to repeat code only if it makes it easier to understand by others

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
